### Project Description
The bank turns to us for help: it wants to develop a loyalty campaign to retain customers, but for this it needs us to find out the main reasons for the outflow of customers.

### What case are we solving?
Conduct an intelligence analysis in order to identify the most important signs of outflow. After that, the bank will be able to build a machine learning model that will predict the customer's departure.

**Competition conditions:**
It is necessary to build graphs based on tabular data. 

**Quality metric**
We process a large amount of data, having previously grouped and filtered the data by attribute.

**What we practice**
We learn to draw graphs based on tabular data. Tabular data is sorted, grouped, and new features are added for a more accurate assessment of banking activity.


### The short information about Data. 
In the table from the bank provided a table on some grounds

### Stages of work on the project.
- We analyze the resulting table, we will identify quantitative and categorical features.
- Group and filter data, if necessary, for plotting when performing tasks.
- Let's list all versions of libraries in the file requirements.txt.
- We arrange it accordingly on GitHub
- The code must be reproducible.

### Result
We have built graphs on the basis of which we have drawn conclusions and made the necessary recommendations for making managerial decisions.

### Conclusion
This has become a good practice for me, how large tabular information can be processed, as well as visualized on a graph, in order to obtain appropriate conclusions and actions.
