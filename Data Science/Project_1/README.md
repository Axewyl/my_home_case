### Project Description
This game in which the PC guesses a number from 1 to 100
and predicts him by himself less than for 20 attempts.
As a result, we get the number from which attempt the PC guessed.

### What case are we solving?
We need to create a program in which the computer will guess a number in the range of numbers from 1 to 100 and do it in less than 20 attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer must to guess a number for minimum quantity of attempts. 

**Quality metric**
The result is estimated by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
We are learning to write good Python code using PEP 8.

### The short information about Data. 
The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is larger or smaller than the number we need.

### Stages of work on the project.
- Write programme on VScode
- We use Jupiter Notebook to present the results of the project.
- Let's list all versions of libraries in the file requirements.txt.
- We arrange it accordingly on GitHub
- The code must be reproducible.

### Result
The program successfully completes the task of guessing the number in less than 20 attempts.

### Conclusion
It was a good practice for me when creating my first Python project of my own and posting it on GitHub.
